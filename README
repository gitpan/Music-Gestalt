Music-Gestalt

This module helps to compose music using musical gestalts (forms). A gestalt is
similar to a list in MIDI::Score format, but so far it only supports note
events, and all parameters are expressed as values between 0 and 1. This allows
for more flexible transformations of the musical material.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
